# Blackjack
A command line game that plays a similar simple version of blackjack.

What I Learned:
- Implement syntactically correct while, do-while, and for loops
- Critically analyze a problem to determine which type of loop will 
  best meet the objectives of effective programming practice to solve 
  the problem.
